# Feature-Engineering
A series of scripts in python that could act as a complete set for feature engineering tasks. 

Python scripts containing feature engineering tools including

- Feature Binning [Numerical, Categorical and datetime features]
  - Create bins using DecisionTrees. [check an example case in feature_binning_result.html]
  - Stability of binned features. [check an example case in binned_features_stability]
  - SQL script is created to include binned features for SQL table. [check an example case in binned_features_sql_cript.txt] 
- Feature Importance [Identifies important features using multiple methods {LOFO, RandomForest, LGBM, XGB}]
  - check an example case in feature_improtance_result.html
- Feature Stability [Stability of Features]
  - check an example case in binned_features_stability
- Feature Profiling [Features are profiled in summarised form and report generated]
  - Create a data summary in-script [check an example case in feature_profiling_summary.html]
  - Create feature Profiling report [check an example case in feature_profiling_report.html]
